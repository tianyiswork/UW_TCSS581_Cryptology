This is an implementation of salsa20 in Python3 for TCSS581 Cryptology

Instructions:

1. Use terminal to go to the location of the script, salsa20.py.
3. You can change the location of King James Bible, encryption 'key', 'counter' and 'nonce' near the end of the script.
4. Run 'python3 salsa20.py' (if you are using Python3).
5. The encrypted cyphertext file will be outputted to the same directory as the script.
6. We could not finish the script by the deadline, since we have some minor issues that still needs to be solved. However, if it works in the future, use 'time python3 salsa20.py' will return the runtime of this encryption.
